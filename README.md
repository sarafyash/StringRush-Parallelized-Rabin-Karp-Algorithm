# StringRush-Parallelized-Rabin-Karp-Algorithm
The Rabin-Karp algorithm, which uses a rolling hash to match patterns in text, is commonly used for exact string matching and plagiarism detection. This work presents a parallel version of the Accelerated Rabin-Karp algorithm, implemented using MPI and Distributed Python disPy.
